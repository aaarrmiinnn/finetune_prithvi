# Project Progress

## Current Status
- **Planning Phase:** Completed and documented in PLAN.md
- **Environment Setup:** Completed with requirements.txt and setup scripts
- **Data Pipeline:** Completed with preprocessing and dataset implementations
- **Model Implementation:** Completed with Prithvi WxC integration
- **Training:** Setup complete, ready for execution
- **Evaluation:** Metrics and visualization utilities implemented
- **Documentation:** Code documentation complete, README updated

## What Works
- Project plan documented with clear objectives and technical approach
- Variables identified for downscaling (T2MMAX, T2MMEAN, T2MMIN, TPRECMAX)
- Technical stack implemented (PyTorch Lightning, Prithvi WxC)
- Complete project scaffolding with all necessary components
- Data preprocessing pipeline with MERRA-2, PRISM, and DEM support
- Model architecture with Prithvi WxC foundation model
- Training pipeline with loss functions and metrics
- Visualization utilities for results analysis

## What's Left to Build
- Execute full training on provided data
- Expand to larger datasets and longer time periods
- Optimize performance and hyperparameters
- Implement advanced visualization and analysis tools
- Create comprehensive benchmarks against baseline methods

## Implementation Status

## Known Issues
- Training has not been executed yet to verify performance
- May need to adjust batch size based on available GPU memory
- Limited dataset (2 dates) for initial proof of concept

## Recent Changes
- Implemented complete project scaffolding
- Created data preprocessing pipeline for MERRA-2, PRISM, and DEM data
- Implemented Prithvi-based downscaling model architecture
- Created PyTorch Lightning training module with losses and metrics
- Implemented visualization utilities for results analysis
- Created run scripts for training and data exploration
- Downloaded and integrated DEM elevation data

## Future Milestones
1. **Initial Training Complete** - Execute first fine-tuning run with evaluation metrics
2. **Expanded Dataset** - Add more dates and regions to the training data
3. **Hyperparameter Optimization** - Tune model for optimal performance
4. **Baseline Comparisons** - Performance compared against traditional methods
5. **Extended Documentation** - Add example notebooks and tutorials
