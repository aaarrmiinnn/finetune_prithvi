# Project Brief: MERRA2-PRISM Downscaling with Prithvi

## Overview
This project focuses on downscaling MERRA2 climate data to match PRISM's higher resolution using the Prithvi deep learning model. The goal is to improve the spatial resolution of climate variables while maintaining accuracy.

## Core Requirements
1. Downscale MERRA2 climate variables to PRISM's resolution (4km)
2. Use IBM's Prithvi-100M model for the downscaling task
3. Support multiple climate variables:
   - Temperature (max, mean, min)
   - Precipitation
4. Incorporate elevation data (DEM) as auxiliary input
5. Train, test, and predict functionality

## Project Goals
1. Accurate downscaling of climate variables
2. Efficient processing of spatial data
3. Flexible configuration system
4. Support for different geographical regions
5. Mixed precision training for performance
6. Comprehensive logging and model checkpointing
