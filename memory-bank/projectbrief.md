# Prithvi Model Fine-tuning Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning the Prithvi model, implementing efficient training scripts with support for both single and multi-GPU environments. The primary goal is to create a robust, scalable training pipeline that can effectively utilize available hardware resources.

## Core Requirements
1. Support for both single-GPU and multi-GPU training
2. Memory-efficient training implementation
3. Flexible configuration system
4. Hardware-aware resource allocation
5. Proper error handling and logging
6. Cross-platform support (Linux and macOS)

## Technical Goals
1. Implement distributed training capabilities
2. Optimize memory usage through gradient checkpointing
3. Provide dynamic batch size and learning rate scaling
4. Maintain consistent configuration across different environments
5. Enable proper hardware detection and utilization

## Success Criteria
1. Successful training runs on both single and multiple GPUs
2. Proper scaling of batch size and learning rate
3. Efficient memory usage
4. Comprehensive logging and error reporting
5. Reproducible training results across different hardware setups
