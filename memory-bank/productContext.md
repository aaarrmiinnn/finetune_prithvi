# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Climate data from different sources often comes at different spatial resolutions, making it challenging to combine and analyze them effectively. MERRA2 provides global climate data but at a coarser resolution than PRISM's regional data. This resolution mismatch limits our ability to perform detailed climate analysis at local scales.

## Solution
This project implements a deep learning-based downscaling approach using the Prithvi model to:
1. Increase the spatial resolution of MERRA2 data to match PRISM's 4km resolution
2. Maintain physical consistency in the downscaled variables
3. Leverage terrain information through DEM data
4. Provide a flexible framework for different geographical regions

## User Experience Goals
1. Easy Configuration:
   - Simple YAML-based configuration
   - Sensible defaults for most parameters
   - Clear documentation of options

2. Robust Training:
   - Automatic mixed precision for efficiency
   - Checkpoint management
   - Progress monitoring through logs
   - Multiple loss metrics for quality control

3. Flexible Usage:
   - Support for different variables
   - Configurable spatial extent
   - Adjustable training parameters
   - Multiple output formats

4. Quality Assurance:
   - Validation metrics
   - Visual comparisons
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error handling and logging

## Expected Outcomes
1. High-resolution climate variables that match PRISM's spatial resolution
2. Physically consistent downscaled fields
3. Efficient processing of large spatial datasets
4. Reproducible results through careful configuration management
5. Clear performance metrics and validation results
