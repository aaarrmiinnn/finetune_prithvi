# Project Progress

## Completed Features
1. Configuration System
   - Standardized config.yaml format
   - Added comprehensive settings
   - Fixed parameter handling issues
   - Implemented proper type conversion

2. Training Scripts
   - Basic training implementation
   - Multi-GPU support
   - Memory optimization
   - Cross-platform compatibility

3. Error Handling
   - Improved error messages
   - Added proper logging
   - Fixed syntax issues in f-strings
   - Enhanced configuration validation

## Current Status
- Version 1.0.0 tagged as stable
- Working on multi-GPU training improvements
- All core scripts operational
- Configuration system stabilized

## Known Issues
1. Configuration
   - Previous issues with mask_ratio parameter (FIXED)
   - Learning rate format inconsistencies (FIXED)
   - Checkpoint parameter naming (FIXED)

2. Training
   - F-string syntax errors in multi-GPU script (FIXED)
   - Config file creation issues (FIXED)
   - Device handling improvements needed
   - Batch size scaling refinement needed

## Next Steps
