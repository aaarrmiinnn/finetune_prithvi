# Progress Log

## Data Preprocessing and Visualization (March 2024)

### Data Loading and Initial Visualization
- Implemented data loading functions for both MERRA-2 and PRISM datasets
- Created visualization scripts to compare MERRA-2 and PRISM data
- Added DEM data loading capability

### Data Processing Improvements
1. Fixed MERRA-2 temperature conversion:
   - Properly converting from Kelvin to Celsius during data loading
   - Temperature ranges now physically reasonable (-10째C to 30째C)
   - Added proper units and metadata handling

2. Fixed PRISM data handling:
   - Corrected initial assumption about PRISM data scaling
   - Verified actual data ranges using metadata:
     - Temperature (tdmean): -25.26째C to 18.48째C
     - Precipitation (ppt): 0mm to 70.95mm
   - Improved metadata extraction from XML files
   - Added proper attribute handling for both temperature and precipitation

3. Visualization Improvements:
   - Implemented consistent temperature ranges for comparison
   - Fixed data orientation issues
   - Added proper units to plot titles
   - Improved colormap selection for different variables

### Current Status
- Data loading pipeline is now working correctly
- Temperature and precipitation data show physically reasonable values
- Spatial patterns match expected climatological features:
  - Clear north-south temperature gradient
  - Orographic effects visible in precipitation
  - Higher resolution features visible in PRISM data

### Known Issues
- None currently, data preprocessing is working as expected

### Next Steps
1. Implement data validation checks
2. Add data augmentation techniques
3. Create training/validation/test splits
4. Begin model development
